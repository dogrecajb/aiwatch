        'Nick Beckstead describes his experience working at GiveWell for two months for a trial work period. He describes his work as involving literature searches, literature evaluation, and cost-effectiveness models. He describes GiveWell as having a direct feedback culture and less autonomy than academia, though he says that the latter was not a problem for him because he and his manager were in synch. He also notes that GiveWell is strong in terms of personal development and the impact of the work, and he personally also found the job satisfying. Ultimately, Beckstead chose to work at the Future of Humanity Institute instead, but recommends to people interested to try a trial work period at GiveWell' /* notes */

        'On his personal blog, Jacy Reese describes his experience working at GiveWell in the summer of 2014. He says he thoroughly enjoyed his time, and felt the employees epitomize effective altruist virtues of altruism and critical thinking, as applied not just to charities and causes but also topics like contemporary political issues and nutrition. He describes GiveWell''s investigative process as a "unique combination of qualitative and quantitative reasoning" and says that, after joining GiveWell, he shifted to viewing GiveWell as a pilot study of strategic philanthropy. He says: "By first investigating a cause with relatively large amounts of academic and rigorous data available, GiveWell could invest in procedural information before venturing into less easily quantified causes. This new understanding partially eased my concerns, but I still fear GiveWell’s investigative process overemphasizes measurability — even in GiveWell Labs — but I am optimistic about the future of their investigations, particularly in the causes of global catastrophic risks and animal agriculture."' /* notes */

He lists the following as things GiveWell does well as an employer: flexible working schedule, access to co-founders and senior staff, receptiveness to staff input, clear communication about performance and trajectory, and hard-working culture. He lists the following areas to improve upon: top-down decision making, time tracking, performance evaluation, team building, and lack of explicit emphasis on self-care.

However, the part starting from "If someone was listening and they were considering working at GiveWell, what are the most satisfying things about working at GiveWell and what are some things that you wish you could change if you could?" discusses the experience of working at GiveWell. Snowden mentions a focused and quiet office culture but a vibrant Slack culture, much less formal intra-company communication than public-facing communication, but a lot of seriousness in the work environment. Snowden encourages people with skillsets matching any of GiveWell''s job postings to apply to GiveWell' /* notes */
