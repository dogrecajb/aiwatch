        'Lauren Lee, who recently departed CFAR after working there for two years, explains what she considers the positives and negatives of the CFAR work environment, and in particular argues that it is not a good work environment if burnout is a concern. This is the third of her comments on the post, which itself is about burnout, with the first two comments being about general strategies for dealing with burnout. The comment would later be deleted on the EA Forum for being too community-related, but survives on the EA Forum Reader that is being linked to' /* notes */
