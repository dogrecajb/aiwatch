        'Lauren Lee, who recently departed CFAR after working there for two years, explains what she considers the positives and negatives of the CFAR work environment, and in particular argues that it is not a good work environment if burnout is a concern. This is the third of her comments on the post, which itself is about burnout, with the first two comments being about general strategies for dealing with burnout. The comment would later be deleted on the EA Forum for being too community-related, but survives on the EA Forum Reader that is being linked to' /* notes */

He also talks about how CFAR decided not to run a fundraiser in 2018 because they felt it would be in bad taste after the Brent Dill controversy, and how this leaves them more cash-strapped now.' /* notes */

Adam Scholl, a CFAR instructor, replies: "Currently CFAR is on sabbatical, which we planned to allocate a couple months this year toward anyway. I.e., we''re reading, and learning and scheming, and in general trying to improve ourselves in ways that are hard to find time for during our normally-dense workshop schedule. We''re considering a range of options for what to do next—e.g. online workshops, zoom mentoring, helping other orgs in some way—but we haven''t yet settled on a decision."' /* notes */

She also states the importance of assisting people toward being able to do AI alignment research, and, whereas she thinks that locating and helping educate potential researchers is expensive, she thinks they’re worth it.' /* notes */
