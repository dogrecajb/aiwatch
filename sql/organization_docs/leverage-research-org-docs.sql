The update describes the history of Leverage Research featuring inside viewpoints, and in particular, it gives Leverage Research''s perspective on various decisions it has received criticism for, including publishing very little, removing content from their website, and errors in dealing with the effective altruist (EA) community. The post also describes the current state of Leverage Research and what to expect from it going forward' /* notes */
