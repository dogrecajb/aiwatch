It is mainly focused on how organizations with remote employees can effectively hire and onboard new employees. Some of the organizations are completely remote (they have no central office) whereas others have both on-site and remote employees. Common themes emphasized by multiple participants include: using "culture add" and not just culture fit (to reduce risk of homogeneity), frequent check-ins, in-person meetings where feasible, and culture orientation for new employees (either an explicit orientation session, or through Slack and check-in meetings).' /* notes */

It is mainly focused on how organizations with remote employees can maintain a healthy work-life balance. Some of the organizations are completely remote (they have no central office) whereas others have both on-site and remote employees. Common themes emphasized by multiple participants include: work-life separation through time (keeping clear working hours boundaries) and space (e.g., having a designated space for working in one''s home), open and proactive communication, encouraging time off with leadership setting an example, and keeping a healthy level of social interaction through tools such as Slack.
